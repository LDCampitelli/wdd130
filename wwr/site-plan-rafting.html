<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>To attract more customers by showcasing the services, prices, locations, and reviews of the rafting business.</p>
<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>Scenario 1:

    The target customers are young adults (18-35 years old) who are looking for an adventurous and fun activity to do with their friends or family. They are mostly students or professionals who have a moderate income and enjoy outdoor sports and nature.
    They want to experience the thrill of rafting in a safe and guided way, and to have a memorable time with their companions. They also want to learn more about the river, the wildlife, and the history of the area.
    They expect to find a website that showcases the different rafting options, the prices, the schedules, the safety measures, and the testimonials of previous customers. They also want to see photos and videos of the rafting experience, and to be able to book online or contact the company easily.
    Their needs that arent being met are the lack of information and availability of rafting services in their area, and the difficulty of finding a reliable and trustworthy company that offers quality and affordable rafting trips.
    They will usually access the website from their mobile devices, as they are more likely to search for rafting opportunities on the go, or to share the website with their friends via social media or messaging apps.
    Scenario 2:
    
    The target customers are middle-aged couples (40-60 years old) who are looking for a relaxing and scenic activity to do with their partners. They are mostly retirees or professionals who have a high income and enjoy traveling and exploring new places.
    They want to experience the beauty and tranquility of rafting in a comfortable and leisurely way, and to have a romantic time with their partners. They also want to enjoy the local cuisine, culture, and attractions of the area.
    They expect to find a website that showcases the different rafting options, the prices, the amenities, the guides, and the reviews of previous customers. They also want to see photos and videos of the rafting experience, and to be able to customize their rafting package or contact the company easily.
    Their needs that arent being met are the lack of variety and quality of rafting services in their area, and the difficulty of finding a company that offers personalized and luxurious rafting trips.
    They will usually access the website from their desktop or laptop computers, as they are more likely to plan their rafting trip in advance, or to compare the website with other travel websites or blogs.
    Scenario 3:
    
    The target customers are families with children (5-15 years old) who are looking for an educational and fun activity to do with their kids. They are mostly parents or grandparents who have a low to moderate income and enjoy learning and spending time with their kids.

They also want to see photos and videos of the rafting experience, and to be able to download educational materials or contact the company easily.
    Their needs that arent being met are the lack of accessibility and affordability of rafting services in their area, and the difficulty of finding a company that offers suitable and enjoyable rafting trips for kids.
